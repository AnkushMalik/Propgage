# PropGage

* An estimated 2 billion working-age adults globally have no access to the types of formal financial services delivered by regulated financial institutions.
* According to Times survey, there are about 10 million asset holders looking for mortgages in India.
* People have to do all the legwork to find the best deals.
* People donâ€™t get satisfactory loan even after having sufficient assets

## Our Goals

* To provide more affordable finance alternatives to disadvantaged and low-income people who, like the unbanked/underbanked, may have little to no access to mainstream financial services.
* To provide the satisfactory value of loan from trustful resources to the borrower for their assets.
* To reduce the unnecessary legwork of the borrower.
* To scale and grow the business of banks and brokers.

## What it does?

* We remove your legwork to create a mortgage.
* Someone who needs a mortgage having to go out and compare a whole bunch of different schemes at different banks or brokers they come to our platform
* To provide satisfactory amount of loan with decent interest, we have built a bidding system in which lenders  propose different kind of offers to grab a deal.
* This will create a competition between the lenders.
* Every lender will want to increase their business so they will compete
